## Option 3: Simpler WhatsApp Solution - WhatsApp Web API

Use **WhatsApp Web API** directly (no business email needed, but more technical):

### Using Baileys or WhatsApp Web.js
- ✅ No business email required
- ✅ Uses your personal WhatsApp
- ✅ Free
- ⚠️ More technical setup
- ⚠️ Can disconnect if phone goes offline

**I can help you set this up if you want!**

## Option 4: Email Notifications Only (Simplest)

**Skip WhatsApp entirely** and use email notifications only:
- ✅ Already working (Resend)
- ✅ No setup needed
- ✅ Professional
- ✅ Works for all customers
- ❌ Not as instant as WhatsApp

**This is already set up and working!**

## Option 5: Alternative Providers (No Business Email)

### A. Wati.io
- Sometimes accepts personal emails
- Try: https://www.wati.io/
- Good for e-commerce

### B. ChatAPI
- More flexible requirements
- Try: https://chatapi.com/
- WhatsApp Business API

### C. Evolution API (Self-hosted)
